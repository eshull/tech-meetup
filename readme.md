## What was the name of the tech event?

## What date did it occur?


## Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?

The PDX Ruby Brigade put on the event. It was hosted at New Relic in Downtown Portland.


## What was the format of the event?

The format of the event was a mixture of presentation, Q&A, and social networking.  

## What was the topic or main focus of the event?



## What made you want to attend this particular event?

I am really interested in being a Ruby developer, but I don't know much about the Ruby community and support that the language has in Portland. I wanted to meet and hear from people working in Ruby.

## What was the highlight of the event?

It was really great to see a panel of four different people talk about their experiences and backgrounds in coding, and how that related to Ruby. It was very encouraging to hear the struggles and real life experiences that people in the Ruby community have.


## What did you learn from this experience?

I learned that Ruby is not a dying language like I have heard some people say. I learned that people come to software development from many different backgrounds, and this can be seen as a strength instead of a weakness.

## If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)

It was a little intimidating as a Junior Developer to be around so many knowledgeable developers. The organizers did a really great job of making everyone feel welcome.

## Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?

Definitely, I am planning on attending the next meeting. Even if you aren't a Ruby developer, I think you could learn from the speakers and meet some interesting people.

## Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.
